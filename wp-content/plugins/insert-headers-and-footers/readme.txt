This plugin allows you to add extra scripts to the header and footer of your blog by hooking into wp_head and wp_footer.

== Description ==

Insert Headers and Footers is a simple plugin that lets you add scripts like Google Analytics to your WordPress site without having to get your hands dirty in code. Moreover, the simple interface gives you one place where you can add all of you scripts rather than dealing with dozens of plugins.
